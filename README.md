***

There's two year since I discovered this game, I enjoyed this year too much unfortunable I couldn't continue, but I think that is a good improvement. Hope you like my resolution of the puzzles.

More information here: [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

This year allowed me to dive more into trees, graphs and recursive functions this allowed me to keep growing.


## Lenguage:

This year I made the puzzles in *C#* again.

**Merry christmas, Wylli**
